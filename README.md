	- You can also replace this activity with another lesson from [teacherslearningcode.com](http://teacherslearningcode.com/en). For example:
		- Wildlife Soundscapes
			- Starter Project Here (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/147165193/)
			- Video Tutorial Here (https://youtu.be/o_lV16MlcW4)
				- Follow along the lesson (http://teacherslearningcode.com/en/lessons/wildlife-soundscapes) and have teachers try out extensions and modifications!
	- Cover concepts like:
		- Logic and reasoning (like events, loops, conditionals)
		- Online vs desktop tool (both free!)
